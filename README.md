# Game of Thrones Interactive Map

This is an interactive map based on the popular TV series Game of Thrones built using React, Leaflet, Node.js, and MongoDB.

#### Deploy Repo

The app has been deployed using heroku from a different repo which can be found here [https://github.com/LukasV3/g.o.t-interactive-map-heroku-deploy](https://github.com/LukasV3/g.o.t-interactive-map-heroku-deploy/). The deploy repo is simply the server files along with the compiled and minified client build folder from this repo. Both repos feature the same code however I had to create the deploy repo so heroku can run properly.

#### Technologies Used

Inspiration for the app came from Patrick Triest's implementation using Webpack, Leaflet, and framework-less Javascript components on the frontend and Node.js (koa), PostGIS, and Redis on the backend.

I have implemented it using **React**, and **Leaflet** on the frontend, and **Node.js (express)**, and **MongoDB (mongoose)** on the backend. I have kept much of the styles the same and have focused on implementing the same functionality using entirely different technologies.

#### Structure

- `client/` - The frontend app code.
- `server/` - The backend app code.
